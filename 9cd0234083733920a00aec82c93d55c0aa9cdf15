      "message": "__attribute__((destructor)) works as a lib too, and can be put in its own file if you want to extend on it.\nI don\u0027t understand the point of removing that with the ERROR* macros -- it feels like you\u0027re just creating exit codes where we won\u0027t call the destructor?\n\n(that might get clearer as I read the next commits)",

      "message": "The problem here is that the backends are now stored in a context structure passed around the library, and since the __attribute__((destructor)) requires a function with no argument, I can\u0027t give it the context we carry around. \n\nSo I need a way to call \"exit_backends\" with the context as an argument, and between calling it manually before each \"error\", \"error_at_line\" and \"exit\" would be annoying, I decided to swap those for a macro that will do the exact same job as the __attribute__((destructor)).\n\nIf you have a better way, don\u0027t hesitate to tell me, I do agree my solution isn\u0027t exactly pretty.",

      "message": "ah, I didn\u0027t think it through, that makes sense... Without global this cannot work...\nIf there isn\u0027t going to be multithreading, having a global list of ctx (or single global extern ctx) would work; what\u0027s needed for reusability here isn\u0027t the removal of globals but exposing them as an interface to the rbh-find for external use (library or overloaded version).\n\nThat said thinking of it from a library point of view most libraries don\u0027t call exit and just leave it to the caller, so it might be better like this ultimately. Would need to add a ctx_finish() generic function or something for backends to hook into though.",
