I assume the point is that you\u0027ll be adding actions for lustre?\n\nIt\u0027s a bit ugly but I\u0027m tempted to say adding actions globally and just saying ENOTSUPP when it\u0027s not handled in action switch is probably just as good...\n\n\n\nas a side note, I really dislike having this code duplicated, having str2predicate return PRED_INVALID or something and calling it preemptively might be ever so slightly less efficient but would avoid lots of potential confusion if we get this wrong when updating...",

      "message": "Indeed we plan on adding actions for Lustre. So yes, I should just move str2action and str2predicate here directly. \n\nHowever, I do not understand what you mean by \"adding actions globally\" ? You mean that the actions we want to add for Lustre should be added to rbh-find directly ?\n\n\nFor the side note, I also agree, but it\u0027s also a larger issue because of the other functions in rbh-find that exit the program, forcing rbh-find functions to be the last called in the overload chain.",
