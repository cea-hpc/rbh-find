I assume the point is that you\u0027ll be adding actions for lustre?\n\nIt\u0027s a bit ugly but I\u0027m tempted to say adding actions globally and just saying ENOTSUPP when it\u0027s not handled in action switch is probably just as good...\n\n\n\nas a side note, I really dislike having this code duplicated, having str2predicate return PRED_INVALID or something and calling it preemptively might be ever so slightly less efficient but would avoid lots of potential confusion if we get this wrong when updating...",

You mean that the actions we want to add for Lustre should be added to rbh-find directly ?\n\nYes, we could just not move this (keep CLI parsing in common code) and add lustre actions directly there; non-lustre find would just fail if the options were given there because it\u0027s not listed in the various switches.\n\nThat being said, I\u0027m not seriously believing we\u0027d do this...",
