      "message": "(minor) Alright, there is a lot to say, but it\u0027s getting late here, so I don\u0027t want to spend too much time on it. Overall, it\u0027s great that you took the time to write tests, I know I should have.\n\nSummarizing a bit, skipping over the minor stuff:\n\n- In most situations, you want to use \"@\" instead of \"*\" (eg. \"${array[@]}\") [0]\n- It\u0027s good practice to quote bash variables, unless you want to make it clear that the variable should never contain spaces or simply cannot (eg. when you declare an integer variable: `local -i var`)\n- I am seeing some for loops with indices that could probably become `for var in \"${array[@]}\"`\n- Ideally, when it comes to temporary files, it\u0027s better to generate the file with `mktemp` as it protects you from tests hysteresis (when the previous test run affects the next one) or unfortunate setups (when a user just happens to have a file like that in their filesystem).\n- The previous point applies to any persistent resources.\n- The tests look like they require a running mongodb server on localhost. It\u0027s not too bad because we don\u0027t have tests yet anyway, so we\u0027re trading \"no tests at all\" vs. \"a few tests that don\u0027t work unless you have the right setup\". Still, that\u0027s not great.\n\n----------\n\nIf you\u0027re into bash, I spent some time writing a test harness a few years back [1]. I meant to use it in robinhood but never took the time to do it. Feel free to ignore this part of the comment as not even I know exactly how good a fit it would be in practice.\n\n[0] https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html\n[1] https://github.com/shypa/bunny",
