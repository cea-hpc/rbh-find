      "message": "Hi, sorry for the delay.\n\nJust a comment on the method: it looks to me like this patch series is meant to ease the implementation of features in rbh-find-lustre. Is this correct?\n\nIf so, can you explain what is to be gained from merging these changes in rbh-find and not just in rbh-find-lustre?\n\nAlso, could you point to a couple of commits in rbh-find-lustre that were made possible thanks to this refactor?",
