      "message": "(minor) Why not use `difflines` here as well?\n\nIt ends up being more code, and less robust code at that:\n\n $ output\u003d\" \"\n $ [ -z $output ] \u0026\u0026 echo empty || echo not empty\n empty\n $ printf -v output \u0027\\n\u0027\n $ [ -z $output ] \u0026\u0026 echo empty || echo not empty\n empty\n\n(you need to quote `output` with [ ], or use [[ ]])\n\nAlso, from a higher-level perspective, checking that a given (complex) filter matches nothing is less valuable than checking that it matches at least one thing. Unless the filter truly never matches anything.",
